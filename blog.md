Spring training us underway, which means that we are just about a month away from
exiting the darkness that is the MLB offseason. It also means that fantasy baseball
players of the world are in the thick of preparing for their fantasy drafts -- the
process used to assign players to fantasy rosters.

There are tons of ways to prepare for a fantasy draft. Player research. Projections.
Practicing with mock drafts. Gut feelings.The problem with fantasy drafts is that they are wildly unpredictable.  You are
generally competing with about ten other players that have the exact same objectives
as you, so it's very unlikely that you have your eye on players that will not be in
high demand.

So what else can we do to prepare?  Because of the unpreditcablly of the draft, arming
yourself high-level heuristics (i.e. rules-of-thumb) might be more useful than a detailed
plan that will inevitably blow up when another player picks Bryce Harper to repeat his
historic 2015 or snags a sleeper like Ketel Marte before your get a chance.

Over the past couple weeks, I've been collecting data from ESPN's publicly accessible
fantasy baseball leagues.  I have all of the league settings and draft results from the
past five seasons, and I am collecting 2016 as it comes in.

## Fantasy baseball is on the rise

There are some caveats to the data that I collected (I cannot see data for private
leagues), but it is very clear the fantasy baseball is continuting to grow in popularity.
Managing and running a fantasy baseball league used to be very cumbersome, but this
is no longer the case.  Sites like ESPN, Yahoo!, and CBS offer platforms that let you
customize and run a league with very little effort.

It will be interesting to see if the growth continues, or if the rise of Daily Fantasy
Sports will cut into fantasy baseball's market share.  I haven't yet ventured into the
world of DFS -- but even if I do decide I want that instant gratification, I will always
play full-season fantasy baseball.

## Is the Offline Draft Dead?

When I first started playing fantasy, drafts were a Sunday afternoon in a buddy's basement.  It takes
forever, and you occasially end up with the same player on two different rosters, but it's so much
more fun!  However, the numbers show that Offline Drafts are dying -- but is this actually happening?
My guess? Leagues are still getting together to do drafts in person, but are opting to
use the online tools to actually run the draft. Managing a live draft defintely feels
cooler than sitting in front of a computer, but computers do a much better job of keeping
drafts moving, on track, and ensuring that rules are followed.  Also, computers aren't likely to be
inebriated during the draft, and that's certainly not the case for many in person drafts.

## Are auctions on the rise?

About five years ago, my league switched to an auction draft. Instead of a typical Snake draft where teams pick in
a sequence that "snakes" such that the player with the first pick in round N gets the last pick in round N + 1.

Players are clearly drafting differently between the different styles.  There
are probably a variety of reasons for this, but one
